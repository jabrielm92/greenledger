## 1. TARGET AUDIENCE

### Primary: EU SMBs affected by CSRD
- **Company size:** 50–500 employees
- **Revenue:** EUR 10M–100M
- **Industries:** Manufacturing, logistics, food & agriculture, construction, retail, professional services
- **Geography:** Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium
- **Job titles:** CFO, Head of Sustainability, Compliance Manager, Operations Director, ESG Officer
- **Pain point:** CSRD compliance deadline approaching, no budget for $50K+ enterprise ESG platforms, drowning in spreadsheets

### Secondary: UK companies preparing for ISSB/UK Sustainability Disclosure Standards
### Tertiary: Accounting firms and consultancies serving EU SMBs (channel partners)

---

## 2. VALUE PROPOSITION (use in all marketing)

**One-liner:** "CSRD compliance on autopilot — built for SMBs, not Fortune 500 budgets."

**Elevator pitch:** GreenLedger automates ESG data collection, Scope 1/2/3 emissions calculation, and CSRD/GRI/SASB-compliant report generation for SMBs — in minutes, not months. Upload your utility bills and invoices, and AI handles the rest. Starting at $249/month vs. $30K–$100K/year for enterprise tools.

**Key differentiators:**
1. AI-powered document extraction (upload a bill, get emissions data in seconds)
2. Multi-framework support (CSRD, GRI, SASB, ISSB) from one dataset
3. 10x cheaper than enterprise alternatives (Watershed, Persefoni, Sphera)
4. No consultants, no 6-month implementation — self-serve in 10 minutes
5. Audit-ready traceability (every number linked to its source document)
